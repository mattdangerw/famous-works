# Famous Works

A collection complete works of famous authors from Project Gutenberg as txt
files. These files can be useful as datasets in machine learning algorithms.
Some minimal scrubbing has been done--removing text from Gutenberg, dedications
and tables of contents.

Not an official datatset, but putting this online in case its useful to others.
